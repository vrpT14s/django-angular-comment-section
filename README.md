# django-angular-comment-section
This is an example/mock project to learn more about mainly angular but also some features of django. I am more interested in the backend and API's (so the backend-frontend connection) than UI/UX so I'll try to make the UI very minimal and simple but reactive so it won't feel like something I can do with plain html/css/js.

## Database Design
Two tables:
1) comments, containing text and a foreign key to the images table
2) images, each record containing a single image

I'm going to avoid having any users because that'll complicate things too much for no reason and won't have an effect on angular.
